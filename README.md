# Business Problem

The city of Seattle is looking to improve low property value neighborhoods. They are looking to give grants to homeowners in neighborhoods with low-grade houses to improve the property value of the neighborhood. They want to know which neighborhoods would benefit the most from and grants. They want to know what should the homeowners use their grants for to improve the property value the most?
